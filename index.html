						<h2>My Story</h2>
					</header>
					<p>I grew up in Hailey, a small town in rural Idaho. I participated in a dual immersion program that gave me my first introduction to the inequities present in my community. My passion for addressing these inequities has only grown. Throughout my two years of medical school, I have learned the importance of finding balance and growing community and the challenges of being part of a minority in medicine. I have strived to be a positive presence in my community through coaching high school basketball, participating in community COVID vaccination and testing, writing Letters to the Editor of local newspapers, and advocating against gender discrimination in medicine.</p>

						<h2 style="text-align: left">Go Bears! (I mean Huskies)</h2>
						<p style="text-align: left">As a varsity athlete at Johns Hopkins, I found identity and community through the diverse group of teammates that I had the honor of playing with over four years. After graduating, it was important to me that I continue to be involved in women’s basketball to help mentor other young women, so I began volunteering with Moscow High School girls’ basketball. I am privileged to have worked with 25 wonderful young women who have reminded me about the power of empowering others. Coaching has helped me find balance in my life and shown me that community is expansive. It comes from unexpected places; building new communities and finding balance has enriched my life and challenged me to grow my world view and find diversity.</p>

					<h2 style="text-align: right">Valuing the Underserved</h2>
					<p style="text-align: right">As the Hailey TRUST Scholar, I have repeatedly returned to my own Idaho community to work on my clinical skills. This past summer, I also completed a health education project. With a classmate, I researched the effects of housing instability (due to the local housing crisis) on mental health and obstetrical outcomes, interviewed community members and published two Letters to the Editor detailing our findings. Through interviews with individuals experiencing housing instability, public officials looking for a solution, and physicians treating the sequelae, we learned about the ways the housing crisis affected many different communities within the Wood River Valley, particularly the underserved. While the solution to this challenge is ongoing, we shed light on the health outcomes it propagates, and I learned how to contribute to the conversation about issues affecting my community and their possible solutions.</p>

						<h2 style="text-align: left">Vaccines in Arms</h2>
						<p style="text-align: left">When COVID hit the US, I was working as a medical assistant in a primary care office in LA. When the time came to leave to matriculate into UWSOM, I felt guilty to leave an amazing group of coworkers and friends during such a tumultuous time. Last spring, I leapt at the opportunity to coordinate medical student involvement in COVID mass-vaccination efforts across North Idaho and to help my new community beat the pandemic. I developed a project with support from the local hospital, in which I organized student training in COVID vaccination and coordinated the volunteer schedule for mass vaccination across three different clinics. Together, Idaho WWAMI students administered over 4,000 COVID vaccines across the Palouse. Through this effort I learned the importance of understanding when people need support and finding creative ways to be a part of the solution.</p>

						<p style="text-align:left">This fall, this morphed into coordinating student support in Gritman Hospital and their drive-through testing clinic as COVID sent Idaho into Crisis Standards of Care. WWAMI students helped residents access PCR testing and were trained in using the CAPR, a hooded form of personal protective equipment used to filter air, in order to visit hospitalized COVID+ patients who otherwise were not allowed visitors.</p>
					
					<p style="text-align:left">Through my health education project last summer, I learned the importance of talking about patients’ mental health and the idea that curing someone’s illness isn’t the same as helping them heal. This was especially true for hospitalized COVID patients, and I hope that this project helped those patients heal with a little more ease.</p>

						<h2 style="text-align: right">Empowered Women Empower Women</h2>
						<p style="text-align: right">Upon matriculation into medical school, I found a community of physicians across the Palouse who were incredibly supportive of me and my classmates, but that gender discrimination is still pervasive in some corners of medicine. I had been worried that some of my new classmates would be unaccepting of my identity within the LGBTQ community, and after stumbling upon this truth, I felt minimized during clinical activities. When the following class only included eleven women, I found myself feeling dejected and like I needed to help make a change. With friends, I organized a panel to encourage female students from both classes, in conjunction with other female physicians on the Palouse, to talk about their challenges. We advocated for the implementation of counselor office hours to increase accessibility for students struggling with these challenges. During this process, I connected with many amazing women who have constantly challenged and empowered each other. Some of us went one step further and advocated for women’s rights on a statewide level by forming a chapter of Medical Students for Choice despite Idaho passing one of the strictest abortion (and abortion education) laws in the country. I found that even within a larger organization, county, or state we can create space for those whose voices have not been heard.</p>

						<p style = "color: white; font-weight: bold">As a five-year-old I learned to fly-fish with my dad, and it forever tied me to this state. After medical school, I hope to return to a rural Idaho town as a physician. I want to live in a place where I can feel the same sense of connection that I do while standing in the Big Wood River, the Lochsa or the St. Joe, but also somewhere where I am a positive presence in the community. </p>
						<p style = "color: white; font-weight: bold">The first thing everyone asked me when I was accepted to medical school was, “What kind of doctor you want to be?” And while I don’t know which residencies I want to match into or which specialty I will choose, my time at UW has shown me that I want to be the type of doctor who builds up the people and the community around them. My contrasting experiences have taught me that life is complicated, big, and beautiful, and that the more diverse and balanced our experiences are, the better suited we are to connect with patients, show them compassion, and help them heal. I hope to be the type of person who fights to elevate the opportunities for girls, young women, and other individuals to grow into the people they dream of becoming. To show them that there is no one right way to be an athlete or a bookworm, nor one right way to step in and help those around you. UWSOM has laid a wonderful foundation for me, and I am so grateful to be a student where I can help advocate for others, which in turn makes me a better doctor, a better member of my community, and a better person.</p>
